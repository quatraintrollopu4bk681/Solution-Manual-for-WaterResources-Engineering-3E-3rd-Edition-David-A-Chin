  * Water-Resources Engineering provides comprehensive coverage of hydraulics, hydrology, and water-resources planning and management. Presented from first principles, the material is rigorous, relevant to the practice of water resources engineering, and reinforced by detailed presentations of design applications. Prior knowledge of fluid mechanics and calculus (up to differential equations) is assumed.
